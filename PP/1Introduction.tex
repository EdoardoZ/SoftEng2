\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose and Scope}
This document analyze the size, cost and effort of realizing the PowerEnJoy project. It is done relying on Function Points and COCOMO II methodologies. Following the result of these operations, tasks needed to complete the project are identified and grouped in order to obtain a schedule for the project that can be visualized using Gantt chart. At the end of the document, a risks list including appropriate mitigation strategies can be found.
