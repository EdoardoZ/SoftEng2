\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
The system interfaces directly with sensors and actuators of the Cars, like GPS, door locking and unlocking mechanism, battery sensor, power socket detector.

\subsubsection{Communication interfaces}
The system requires internet connectivity across all involved devices.

\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
The system relies on a third party payment service to issue payment requests, and a third party navigation system for the onboard Car equipment which provides driving directions.
