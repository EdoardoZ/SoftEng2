He installs the PowerEnJoy app on his mobile phone, he opens it and looks for a nearby Car on the map. He find one at 200 meters from his home.

He receives the mail with the password, he logs in as PowerUser, and he reserves the previously seen Car. In 20 minutes he is near the car. He opens the app to confirm his proximity to the Car, the system let him ask the unlocking of the Car so that Al can enter, insert his destination on the screen of the Car, start the engine and drive towards his destination. During the ride he can keep the battery level and the current fare under control watching them on Car screen. Once arrived he stops, parks and since he read on the Car screen that he is inside a Safe Parking Area he exits and leaves the Car. The Car is locked automatically and the total charge will be deducted from his payment method. Al receives a mail containing the details about the duration of his ride and the corresponding Total Ride Fare.

\subsection{Scenario 2: No Car available}

Looking around he sees a Car with the PowerEnJoy logo on the side. He googles it and find the PowerEnJoy app. After opening it, he starts looking for that Car in order to reserve it, however he discovers that it is not shown on the map, so it can't be rented. At that point he gives up and falls back to the night service of the local public transport.

\subsection{Scenario 3: Car pooling discount}
Jack is an architect, and he is expected to attend a meeting located in the other side of the city. The day before he finds out that due to the high pollution level his old car is not authorized to be used. Since he needs to carry a lot of big papers with him, he does not want to use the public transport. He decides to rent a car using the PowerEnJoy service. Furthermore he proposes to a neighbour to share the ride, so since both Jack, his wife and his neighbour need to reach the same destination, they can get a discount. The following day Jack opens the PowerEnJoy app, selects the closest Car and, with both his wife and his neighbour, reaches his destination and parks. They leave the Car, and since there were at least three people from the beginning of the ride up to the end, the system applies a discount before deducting the charge. Jack receives a mail containing the details about duration of the ride, discount, and the Total Ride Fare.

\subsection{Scenario 4: Charged ($\geq$50\%) battery discount}

So she decides to take advantage of the PowerEnJoy service, since there is a Special Parking Area few meters from her home.

Since she is eligible for a discount the system applied it before deducting the Total Ride Fare.

\subsection{Scenario 5: Money saving option}
Victor is an hard worker, he has just moved from another city and he hasn't bought a car yet since he need to save as much money as possible. He has just discovered the existence of the PowerEnJoy service and its money saving option. He opens the app, completes the registration and reserves a near Car. Victor gets in the Car before his reservation expires and inserts his destination on the screen of the Car. He enables the money saving option and the navigator shows the Special Parking Areas where he is expected to park in order to get a discount. Victor considers that solution suitable for his needs, so he starts his ride. The navigator drives him to the Special Parking Area, Victor parks the Car and exits it. Within the prescribed time limit he plugs the Car into the power grid, this way the discount is applied.

\subsection{Scenario 6: Reservation cancelled}
Elena is working as babysitter looking after the son of her friends. She left her friends' house only after the child's parents are back, and since they are very punctual people she has already reserved a Car using the PoweEnJoy app. Unfortunately, due to a traffic jam, they are late; after they informed her, she opens the PowerEnjoy app and cancels her reservation.

\subsection{Scenario 7: 1$\euro$ fee}

They immediately close the water, but since there is water everywhere they decide to stay home and clean up the wet floor.
