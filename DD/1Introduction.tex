\subsection{Document Structure}
This document is split in 6 parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Architectural Design:} contains the different architectural views of the system.
    \item \textbf{Algorithm Design:} contains the definitions and the pseudo-codes of the most relevant algorithmic parts of the system.
    \item \textbf{User Interface Design:} contains an overview of how the user interface on the system will look like.
    \item \textbf{Requirements Traceability:} shows the correlation among the requirements defined in the RASD and the design elements contained in this document.
    \item \textbf{Effort Spent:} contains the amount of time each member spent on the document, split between time spent working together and time spent on his own.
    \item \textbf{References:} contains all the references required by this document.
