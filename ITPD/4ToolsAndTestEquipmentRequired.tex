\section{Tools and Test Equipment Required}
\subsection{xUnit}
Most of test that are listed in previous section of this document should (as they're designed to) be implemented by a xUnit compatible test framework depending on the application framework chosen to develop the single subsystem.

\subsection{Mocking tool}
Depending on chosen testing framework, the adoption of an appropriate mocking provider toolkit is strongly recommended to ease and automatize test doubles generation for not yet implemented components.

\subsection{Xamarin Test Cloud}
Xamarin Test Cloud will provide a set of features to run automated tests upon many different emulated user interaction cases and to profile client application performances across different types of supported devices.

\subsection{HockeyApp}
HockeyApp is a platform that provides a set of tools intended to assist the development team during a first stage of alpha and beta distribution such as crash reporting and other useful functions like user metrics and feedback. We plan to use HockeyApp crash reports and metrics to generate issue specific test cases once both User Device Mobile App and Onboard Ride Assistant App have been deployed to testing devices and also during future alpha and beta testing phases.
