\section{Tools and Test Equipment Required}
\subsection{xUnit}
Since we want to give more freedom to the development team we will use a xUnit test framework depending on the programming language chosen from developers (e.g.:  JUnit for Java), for testing all the SBL and generic tests for User Device Mobile and Onboard Ride Assistant Apps.

\subsection{Mocking tool}
As for the test framework, the mocking tool depends from the chosen language (e.g.: Mockito for Java).

\subsection{Xamarin Test Cloud}
Xamarin Test Cloud is a cloud service for run automated tests for user interface and performace of mobile applications. We will use it for testing User Device Mobile App on different devices.

\subsection{HockeyApp}
HockeyApp is a tool that allow beta testing, crash reporting and other useful functions like user metrics and feedback. We will use HockeyApp for generating test cases based on users' crash reports once both User Device Mobile App and Onboard Ride Assistant App has entered the beta phase.
